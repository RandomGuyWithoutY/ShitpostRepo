For decades, superpowers and psychic abilities were thought to be mere science fiction, but the discovery of a certain particle called the "Astron" at the end of the 20th century proved to the world that these wondrous phenomena were real. Nowadays, these abilities have been dubbed "astral abilities," with those who can wield them being knows as "Astrals."

Arihara Satoru is but an ordinary person living in this futuristic world.

However, beneath that guise, he's actually a secret agent working for an organization that uses Astrals.

One day, he receives a new mission:

Pose as a student and infiltrate a famous academy for Astrals.

After successfully transferring into the academy together with his sister Arihara Nanami, he settles into his new life there, meeting new friends like his classmates Mitsukasa Ayase and Nijouin Hazuki, and his upperclassman Shikibe Mayu, among others.

Until an unfortunate accident leads to Mitsukasa Ayase finding out his true identity! And in that situation, he also learns that she has her own big secret...

Adult content includes a few illustrations with veiled nudity and kissing.

I like cats. Ayase likes cat, everyone likes cat.

But for real, this is one of the most high-quality Visual Novel I've ever bought from steam, lmao. All of the girls are very cute and appealing, the storyline is captivating, funny and cute at the same time. The themes are all nice to listen to, overall a very nice gameplay.

I like Ayase the most.

Riddle Joker is a great game.

Well, first I would like to talk about the visual part of the game. She is quite good. I had to get used to the anime style like that, but after a couple of hours of playing everything was fine. The characters don't have a lot of unnecessary detail, and that’s good. Animations, character emotions, transitions, backgrounds – it's all perfectly done in the game. And it's always great to see Chibi Arts for some funny scenes.

I can't say anything special about the music. It fits into the story perfectly. Funny scenes are complemented by good funny music, and active scenes are complemented by active music. While playing, you don’t notice the music much and completely immerse yourself into the game, which means that the music has done its job adding to the overall atmosphere.

Well, story and routes are something incredible. I didn’t expect any fantasy from a visual novel, because Riddle Joker turned out to be my first novel from Yuzusoft, but in the end I liked everything. Each route has its own problem associated with the character chosen for the route. And the solution to these problems is always interesting. It can be a confrontation with some villain or just help in solving a problem that has haunted the character all his life. And solving problems is accompanied by romance, which makes the situation less tense. Yuzusoft novels have a lot of that, but Riddle Joker has more to do with fighting or something like that.

And, of course, hentai scenes deserve special attention. With a special patch the game becomes many times better in some moments, because a lot of arts become completely different. And at the end of the routes, special hentai scenes begin where a lot of good things happen. And it's done beautifully.

So, I love Riddle Joker. It's something new for me. This game was good, that's why I wanted to play another games from Yuzusoft. And it was a good choice.
